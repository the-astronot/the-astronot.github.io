This site is to serve as a place to log my misadventures with technology.
Hopefully, by logging my repeated failures, I might be lucky enough not to make the same ones again.

# About Me

As my github says: I'm an engineer, computer scientist, and maker of things. I completed my undergrad in the Spring of 2023 at RPI, earning a degree in Aeronautical Engineering and Computer Science, focusing on spaceflight, AI\ML, and control systems. Currently, I am continuing my education at RPI where I am pursuing a M Eng. in Aeronautical Engineering, with my project focusing on GNC algorithms. Beginning in the Fall of 2023, I will be a NASA Pathways Intern for Johnson Space Center, where I will continue to hone my skills in GNC. In my spare time, I continue to write code or work on projects that interest me. Most recently, I've continued to practice creating CAD models for 3D printing and learning networking concepts to construct and manage my homelab.
