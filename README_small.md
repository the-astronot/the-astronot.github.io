This site is to serve as a place to log my misadventures with technology.
Hopefully, by logging my repeated failures, I might be lucky enough not to make the same ones again.

# About Me:

I'm a student at RPI studying Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science.
As can be readily seen from my GitHub page, I spend a lot of time on a number of projects; some investigating the intersections of my two fields, others random ideas that interest me.
At any given moment, I'm likely involved in several ongoing projects, mostly software in Python or C++, though for more engineering related tasks, I am versed in MATLAB (indexes should not start at 1). Recently, I have been branching out into experimenting with hardware as well, learning to solder and CAD actual parts to be 3D printed for my cluster computer and go-to telescope.
