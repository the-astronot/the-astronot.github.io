## project-pico

**Description:**

Answering the question "what would file compression software look like if it was written by someone who knew nothing about file compression?"

In all seriousness, I got really into compression for like a week at one point, and ended up writing my own software to try and see how well I'd do. I'm pretty sure it's effectively just a poorly implemented Huffman coding algorithm, but I was pretty proud of it when it actually worked.

This was also my first real time peforming and writing to a file with bit-manipulation in c++.

At some point, when I'm more knowledgeable, I might go back and try messing around with it again.

**Software:**

Explained above. I did actually end up with a working executable that could compress and decompress.
