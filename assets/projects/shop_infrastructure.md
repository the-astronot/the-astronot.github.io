**Description:**
Logging any and all progress/improvements made on my workshop. At some point will also keep inventory/catalog parts and tools for me so that I don't need to spend so much time looking for them.

**Hardware:**
Constantly changing, always trying to get some more.

**Software:**
Nothing yet...

**Pictures:**
