# Project-Atlas

**Status:** On hold

**Description:** Project-Atlas is the name given to my open source go-to telescope that I began designing in the spring of 2021 for the RPI Arch Away.
It consists of a chassis that was partially designed and 3d printed by me, which is controlled by a number of stepper motors powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B+/4. The [code in the project directory](https://github.com/Jormungandr1105/project-atlas) will deal with the calculations required to locate the celestial objects, the movement of the telescope, and taking pictures with the help of the HQ RasPiCamera.

**Hardware:**
- 8in (200mm) f/6 mirror
- Raspberry Pi 3B+/4
- Extruded Aluminum
- Quite a bit of 3d printer filament
- RasPiCam HQ

**Software:**
- Repository linked above ^
- Main code written in Python, might make accompanying app when I finish the rest of it

**Pictures:**
I have to finish first...
