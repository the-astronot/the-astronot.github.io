So my current plan for my mech game multiplayer consists of games of several players with one of the players acting as a host. This is fortunate in terms o cost, as I won't have to pay for servers, but unfortunate for my idea as a whole, since it necessitates a sort of history being kept, influencing the world as a whole, as well as potentially a global market system.
My theoretical solution involves me creating a type of blockchain that is shared with all instances of the game, which can be appended by the game instances of all players, that allows appending purchases and battle outcomes onto it.
Not entirely sure how I'd pull it off, but that's the gist of where my head is at rn.
We'll see how much of that is actually possible.
