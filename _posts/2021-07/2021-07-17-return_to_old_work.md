Today, I set about spending some time on my cluster computer. In a fit of annoyance, I had previously ripped off the Arduino it used for power regulation and led controls in an attempt to make my fight stick work.
In attempting to reconnect the device, I realized that I had never bothered to trim the rods used to hold the body of the computer together.
So, I plugged in my rotary tool and rectified that.

Later on, I tried again to improve on my crypto trader. After messing about for a few hours, I came away with a product that was less successful than what I started with.
Do at this point, I've decided to go ahead and test my current model that only attempts to maximize the amount of each particular cryptocurrency it controls, rather than looking at the rises and falls of the greater market vs the US dollar.
