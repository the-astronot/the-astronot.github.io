Today, I spent more time than I wish to admit trying to add Inverse Kinematics to my mech model for [unitled_unity_game](/projects/untitled_unity_game).
Blender did not make it easy on me, not even alowing me to mirror my armature or connect my limbs the way I wanted to. But, I did it. And I got a basic walk cycle going, so thats pretty cool.
