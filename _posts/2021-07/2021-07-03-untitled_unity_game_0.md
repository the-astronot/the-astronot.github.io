Recently, a friend of mine introduced me to a TTRPG called [Lancer](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf-free).
I really like the game's style, allowance for excessive modification of both characters and mechs, and general feel. Drawing influences from it, as well as other games that have had large effects on me; namely [Elite Dangerous](https://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/Elite_Dangerous/), [Dungeons&Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), and [The Mount and Blade Series](https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord/), I sought to create a new game of my own using Unity.
**Abstract:**
The year is 5512. Humankind has spread throughout one arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. Recent decades have been ones of peace, and humanity as a whole has been witnessing the highest overall quality of life in history...
But all good things must come to and end. Old divisions are resurfacing, factions begin preparing their forces, and the edges of civilization begin to feel the pressure as they become the battlefields of a new war.
All is not lost, however.
The wars of the past, bleak and horrble affairs that nearly wiped humans from the galaxy more than once, have shaped current policies. Even in war, strict limits exist to minimize the bloodshed and casualties endured by all parties. Of course, that didn't stop some in the century previous from walking the fine line, creating the new standard for warfare in the 57th century - Battle Mechs.
Towering mechanical creations, outfitted with armaments and armor, piloted by humans; Mechs, once used on the battlefield, have in recent history found new homes in arenas, startling and amazing fans in sporting brawls. Now, it appears, they will see true combat once again.
You play as a mech pilot, arming and outfitting your mech for FPS style combat in practice battles in the arena, and for fame and glory in the outer rim of civilized space. Win battles, upgrade and purchase new mechs, join a faction, and take on the harsh life of a mech pilot in a galaxy on the brink of chaos.
