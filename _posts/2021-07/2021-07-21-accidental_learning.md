So I spent some time refactoring my code to allow for my javascript to be stored alongside the rest of the current git repo. That took a bit of effort. In the future, I'm going to have to think about the possibility of the scope of the project expanding overtime.
In other news, the ReactJS framework makes more sense to me than any other flavors of javasript I have attempted to learn so far, and I am cautiously optimistic that this might not end up being awful. During my exploration of the language, I finally managed to get how CSS works, and I see its use now, which is good.
Looking forward to have some kind of working prototype for the website up and functioning.
