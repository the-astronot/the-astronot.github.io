Song of the Day: [**Choke**](https://youtu.be/mvJjmWTg7Qo) - *I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME*

I've been thinking for a while about making a repo for setting up my linux installation the way I want. I tend to OS hop and reflash my system from time to time, and it'd be cool to have a script to run to get everything configured the way I like them. Today's final nudge was discovering this [repo](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) that fixes mistyped commands.

Initialized the repo today, planning on working out the structure and adding some scripts when I find some time tomorrow.
