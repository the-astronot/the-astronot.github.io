So by some miracle, my PropSys prof gave us enough examples this hw cycle for me to be able to figure out all of the problems and finish earlier than I expected.

After finshing that work, I figured I'd get around to messing with my bash scripts more and ended up wasting a bunch of time trying to get bash to accept a number of separate commands from a single string.

Even splitting them up into a for loop didn't help, as I needed them to build on one another, which doesn't seem to happen in loops.

Regardless, I ended the night having written a program to setup every node in my cluster. I guess that's what I'll take as success.
