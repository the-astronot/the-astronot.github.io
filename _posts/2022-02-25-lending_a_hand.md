Song of the Day: [**We Didn't Start the Fire**](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g) - *Billy Joel*

I think my generation needs a current version of "We Didn't Start the Fire". I feel like every other day something else is on fire, blowing up, or falling apart.

Anyways, around classes being cancelled because of some light snow today, I found my way into the JEC. My former boss from the Earthquake Lab had asked if I might be able to come in and straighten out aa thing or two with some of their sensors, and I was happy to oblige. Unfortunately, no sooner had I prepped the sensors and calibrator for a test, then their remote system crapped out and required someone to come in and straighten out. Assuming they get their system in order before break, I'll likely try and give it one more shot so that the Phd candidate can get her experiment in.
