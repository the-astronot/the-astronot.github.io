**17 February, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Say It Ain't So**](https://youtu.be/ENXvZ9YRjbo) - *Weezer*

Today was a rough one.

Little to no sleep, bad news, group memebers running the deadline down to the wire. Just a bad day. I ended up reaching the point where I couldn't get myself to focus on homework and decided instead to try and calm down working on the software for deep_thought.

I managed to get the C++ version all the way up and running, Everything necessary for the bare essentials was there: job submission, job execution, queue displaying. When I went to schedule a job however, the output that I got was STILL BUFFERED TO THE END, same as my failed attempt in python. At this point I was irate. And only at this point did I try and refresh my memory of what the output should look like by running a job directly from the command line. As it turns out the Hydra Manager for mpiexec buffers the output until program termination, and has no method of disabling this feature. All this time, I thought popen() was messing me up, or at least it's implementation in python and C++, when all along what I wanted was never possible.

I had to stop for the night upon that realization.

This will mean drastic changes to my scheduler, which I cannot currently comprehend.
