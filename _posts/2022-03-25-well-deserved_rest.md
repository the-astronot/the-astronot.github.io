**25 March, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Fear & Delight**](https://youtu.be/ABS-mlep5rY) - *The Correspondents*

I couldn't sleep last night.

That's not quite true, I fell asleep at 6 this morning, and still made it to lab for noon. So, success...

I did manage to speak with one of my former professors, who gave me permission to use him as a reference for the summer postion. Another box checked! Hopefully I'll have some more concrete details to share soon.

That ends another week! I'm looking forward to some well-deserved rest this weekend. This last week has been *hectic*.
