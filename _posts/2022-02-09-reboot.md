Song of the Day: [**Misanthropic Drunken Loner**](https://youtu.be/iRF1vHd4xl8) - *Days N' Daze*

In the absence of a halfway decent day to test out camera calibration, in my free time I turned instead to reviving old projects.

I spent some time dusting the cobwebs off of my **deep_thought** repo, as well as tossing a layer of wood arm-r-all on the top of my fight stick. I have some hopes that I might be able to get both into semi-functional states in the recent future.

For **deep_thought**, I have plans to finally get the job launcher set up correctly, as well as update the NodeJS site to use the new API I wrote. At some point, I will likely try and actually boot the physical system again, and deal with whatever issues that is sure to be plagued by. I would also like to try and establish some form of easy percentage complete logic for running jobs.
