Song of the Day: [**You Better You Bet**](https://youtu.be/wqPlb5PLBvg) - *The Who*

Java.

My new mortal enemy.

I don't count Dafny, so Java has to be the worst legitimate language I have ever had to use. After another session of hair pulling working on Tuesday's HW, I spent some more time polishing this site. Realizing that my eyes were potentially not the only ones seeing it, I became mildly self-conscious about the way that the site looks on mobile devices, despite my numerous attempts to rectify it.

So, I hit the CSS file again to give it another shot. While I was at it, I realized that the dev tools in the browser allowed me to simulate the screen sizes of different devices. I no longer have to perform my tests by repeatedly resizing the window, and ever better, I can stress test the extremes that I could not otherwise.

In summation, I know I've said it about a million times by now, but the site should be operating as intended for all devices.

Please don't call my bluff.
