## a dumb idea - the beginning

Yesterday, before giving my friend Austin a ride home, we decided to get some food. As we are want to do, neither of us had anywhere in particular that we wanted to go. After a lot of indecisiveness, we ended up making a little chart of the place available, and their related "stats". Using this, we were able to bring ourslevs down to two options and rolled a die. Afterwards, we thought to ourselves, this happens all the time, what if we had a program to take care of all of the setup and save ourselves the time?
In that moment, this idea was born. What originally began as an idea for a simple command-line tool has sprawled outwards into an idea for a web app, capable of recording individuals opinions of restaurants and styles of restaurants, creating parties of users to generate restaurants for, and suggesting restaurants based on avg party data and std_dev of party data.
I actually think this will be a pretty cool tool, as an indecisive person myself, and as a witness to the decisive people in such parties getting rather annoyed at the indecisive amongst them.
