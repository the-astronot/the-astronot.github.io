Today when I returned from NY, I plugged my KM Switch into my rig and finished transferring the rest of my media files to my Windows PC. From now on, I will be hosting my Plex server from there.
One thing that is worth noting, is that my nice Drop Alt Keyboard seems to require more time in the transition than more basic models I had previously tested with.
On the whole though, the whole system is back online.
