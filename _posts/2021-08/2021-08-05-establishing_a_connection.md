Today I was back in Troy, and got my dual monitor arms in place for my move back in with my dual pc setup.

My new usb terminals are late arriving, so I'm hoping to get to work wiring up the KM switch for real tomorrow.
On the software side of things, I think I should be able to use Python to make a cross platform copy paste tool with relative ease.
Right now I'm looking at using a combination of Tkinter for visuals and sockets for connection between the computers.
I laid out a quick prototype script that I'll expand more on tomorrow.
