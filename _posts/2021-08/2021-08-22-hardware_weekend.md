For a while now, I have been dissatisfied by the amount and location of tablespace in my room at school. While I have a decent sized desk, it is not large enough to handle projects tnhat involve both software and hardware. I can either have my keyboard and mouse in front of me, or a soldering iron and rotary tool. Not to mention that that desk is bunked under my bed, eliminating my ability to take advantage of its depth, or stand. For a while now, I've wanted to build myself a small freestanding desk to put on the other side of the room to hold my hardware. This weekend, I decided that wood prices had finally dropped low enough for me to get it done. So thats how I spent my weekend.

Note to future self, STAIN IS INCREDIBLE.

All in all, I think it turned out pretty well, and is surprisingly sturdy for being able to disassemble it flat for moving.
I've got a power strip mounted underneath it, am planning on screwing pegboard into one of the legs, and am thinking about a 3D printed parts storage for the other leg.
