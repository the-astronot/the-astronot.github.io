Finally managed to get the KM Switch successfully wired up today. I only have the one computer with me to test it on, but it seems to alternate back and forth between the two usb ports on it just fine.

It isn't the prettiest thing I've ever made, but hey, it seems to work, so...
Didn't end up shorting any terminals on my laptop or frying any of my fingers, which is a plus.

In other news, I finished the prototype for my very basic copy paste program to allow me to "share" a clipboard between the two desktops.
I was finally forced to figure out regular threading in python, and it isn't pretty, but it works well enough for now.
I'll probably polish it a bit when I get around to it.
I will at the very least set up a bash and batch files to run it on both systems.
