Once I got back from work today, I set about designing the Y motor mount for the telescope in Fusion360. 2 iterations/prints later, and I had a functioning part that fit in the slot. Now all I need is some m3 machine screws (coming Wednesday).
Between prints, I spent a bit of time looking at the crypto prices I've been collecting since I last posted.
And the results are in.
Despite/depending on rates charged by the exchange for transfers between cryptocurrencies, my trading strategy appears too be viable, no matter the climate of the overall crypto market.
Is it perfect?
**Absolutely NOT.**
But it gives returns, and for now, I think that'll be enough.
I'll try and implement it tomorrow probably, we'll see how that goes.
