Song of the Day: [**Starman**](https://youtu.be/aBKEt3MhNMM) - *David Bowie*

And the results are in.

When I used the repo to generate quaternions for the ISS photos, the error between the actual quaternions and those generated fell largely around .005 degrees. That's pretty epic. The largest error I witnessed was approximately .025 degrees, which I'm fairly certain is still far more accurate than the mounting of this hardware on a satellite can achieve.

In short, a success.

In other news, I managed to get the first version of my map generator for the wopr repo working.
