Song of the Day: [**Take Me Out**](https://youtu.be/Ijk4j-r7qPA) - *Franz Ferdinand*

It's been a while, and I have a lot to catch you up on. Starting with the big news, I've passed the first check towards becoming a NASA Pathways intern. I got my referral today informing me that my application would be passed on to the respective locations I had applied to. I cannot express how happy I am to have made it past this first barrier, and I am anxiously looking forward to a shot at an interview.

In terms of other updates, I am somehow miraculously still waiting for official word from RPI that I have been accepted into the Co-Term program. I have unofficially known for months now, but it appears that the paperwork is still working its way around. Speaking of which, I have a master's project to work on now that I'll have to make a separate post about.

More news from the NASA front, it looks like I'll be headed back to Houston this summer to work on a hardware-in-the-loop control systems project that I am wicked stoked about being able to work on.

Still no maps from Vinny, it seems like if I'm going to finish that game, its going to be entirely up to me. We'll see what happens. This semester has been a lot of work with very few breaks.
