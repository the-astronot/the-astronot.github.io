**Update:** Since being referred for the Pathways Internship at JSC, I have been informed that I have made it past the second round of cuts and made it to the interview stage. I can't believe that I've made it this far, and I am very excited for what is to come. Hopefully I can impress enough in the interview to have a shot at the position. I've started prepping for the interview, and I am **very** nervous, as talking about my own soft-skills is not exactly a talent of mine.

In other news, this semester keeps getting longer. I feel like every time I turn around I have 3 more people needing 6 more things from me. I just spent my entire weekend finishing a Mechatronics HW and extended in-class assignment as well as prepping for today's Spaceflight Mechanics exam so that I stand a chance at finishing my AI project for Thursday's deadline and still have time to prep for my interview Friday. All this while trying to figure out my Spaceflight Mechanics project, stay up to date on my Operating Systems class, produce results for my master's project, and continue filling out financial forms for the master's that I finally have written acceptance to. Not to mention prep for heading back down to JSC this summer.

I am **so** tired. I cannot wait for this semester to be over. While the work is all wicked interesting and exciting, I think in my push to get my GPA up last semester, I really burnt myself out and never managed to adequately put myself back together. Having all of the master's paperwork and Pathways application definitely hasn't helped either.
