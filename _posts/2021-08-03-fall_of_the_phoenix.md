While waiting on the usb terminals to arrive, I set about preparing for my new setup. This entailed removing my SSD running Reborn OS from my main computer and moving it to the server, as well as removing my 4TB HDD drive from the server and moving it to the main computer. I figured since it could now be expected to be running Windows at all times, it would fare better at streaming media than the server, which left me wanting.
Of course, this could not go smoothly. My Linux installlation made a fuss about not being able to find the old drives I had put under fstab, and refused to start, so I had to go in with Ubuntu running off a usb stick to modify that file. Afterwards, it ran perfectly. I'm surprised at how snappy it felt with its crappy Pentium processor, but we'll see how long that lasts.
As for my now Windows machine, it of course demanded a fresh installation, for which I am glad I have left one on a usb stick I have perpetually lying around. After that, there was only one more issue...
My 4TB drive must have been set up as an ext4 format, which Windows refused to recognize.
Luckily, I only had about 1.8TB of media installed on it, and with the help of my Ubuntu usb stick, am currently moving those files onto the spare room on my other drives temporarily, so that I might format it as an NTFS for Windows, and then return all of the media to it.
All in all, it was a massive headache, but if this works out, I will be very happy with my new system.
