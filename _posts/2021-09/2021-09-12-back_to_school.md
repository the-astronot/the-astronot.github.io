As is probably overly obvious, it's been a while since I've made any posts.
I just got through my second week of classes, and now that I'm getting things straightened out, I'm hoping I'll be able to get back to some projects.
Now that I'm back in person, I'm trying to get everything sorted out degree-wise. With all of the Covid craziness I haven't been able to see my advisor or actually fill out the forms to apply for the second degree, and as such, am still just an Aerospace Engineering Major. Hopefully that will change with my appointment this Thursday.
At least I hope so.
I really hope that all of this hasn't just been for nothing.
