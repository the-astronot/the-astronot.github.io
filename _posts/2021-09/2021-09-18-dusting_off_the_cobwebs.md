Spent today making some ethernet cables to connect my cluster to the ethernet splitter stationed at my desk. Dusted off the cobwebs that had been collecting on it, and tried booting it up. It seems to have fared well since the last time I ran it. In the coming days, I will be running some tests with my new launcher and seeing how it responds.
