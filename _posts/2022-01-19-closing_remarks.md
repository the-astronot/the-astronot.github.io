Song of the Day: [**Rock the Casbah**](https://youtu.be/bJ9r8LMU9bQ) - *The Clash*

I made my final major updates to terminal_tv. Users are now able to switch between resolutions during a video and resume from where they left off. While some minor tweaks and formatting/commenting changes will doubtlessly be required, this will in all likelihood be the last post I make regarding it.

No real lessons learned, just a reminder to myself to always make everything as modular as possible.

Here's a video of the program in use playing the pilot of [Futurama](https://youtu.be/KdTCKe3PFhQ).
