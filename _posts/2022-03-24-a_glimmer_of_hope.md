Song of the Day: [**On Top Of The World**](https://youtu.be/w5tWYmIOWGk) - *Imagine Dragons*

I got some good news today about a job for this summer!

It's too early to say much more than that, but suffice to say, I am very excited.

Other than that, still working off of the high of getting that Java HW finished. Hoping I'll end up with a decent grade on the written portion. I also finally got the grade back for the exam I took for that class like 5 weeks ago, 2 points over the average! For a class that I am actively just trying to get through, that's not bad at all.

Overall, a pretty stellar 48 hours for me.

Here's hoping my luck holds.
