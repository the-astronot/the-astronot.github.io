For a while now, I have been coming up with different ideas to diagnose/examine/output information about my cluster computer. These thoughts have gone through several iterations, from led arrays to lcd screens.
Then, on a whim the other day, I looked into hosting a website on the head node that will provide an estimate of the remaining time on the current job, fan speed, and other information.
So, at long last, I am finally actually looking into producing a small program with javascript that is actually meant to be run on a server.
For this, I'm trying to teach myself NodeJS and ReactJS. I guess we'll see how that goes...
