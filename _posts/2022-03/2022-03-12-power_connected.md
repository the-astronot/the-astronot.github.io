Song of the Day: [**Stacy's Mom**](https://youtu.be/dZLfasMPOU4) - *Fountains of Wayne*

Spent today trying to finish up the cable runs for the cluster moving. I did alright, it isn't completely done, but I have all of the power cables run, save for the fans. I'm still trying to decide how I want them to be wired, since I would ideally like to have them controlled by the arduino in addition to the led strip and relays.

I still have to make and run the ethernet cables for the remaining like 5 nodes, but I really wasn't feeling it today. Maybe I'll get it done tomorrow and then I can test the system in its entirety so I can round out the rest of the code required. Currently, the nodes still have the original code from like a year ago on them, so that's a lot to work with.

I managed to ssh into the head node and control the arduino through it, boot the system, and set the led strip color.

Anyways, I took a video of the cluster powering on [here](https://youtu.be/PydZopnubTc)
