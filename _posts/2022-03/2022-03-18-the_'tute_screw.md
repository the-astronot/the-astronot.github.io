Song of the Day: [**The Foggy Dew**](https://youtu.be/IKU1UxRlE0Q) - *Derek Warfield & The Young Wolfe Tones*

No real work done to round out the week, mostly due to trying to put out the raging dumpster fire that is my class sign-ups for next fall.

I have to take 2 CS classes on AI, and I had found 2 that I thought would be cool. The official list of fall classes was supposed to be out last week. It came out Wednesday night. My window to sign up is at 10:00 am on Monday. Neither of the classes I was planning on taking are being taught. No warning. Not a word from the admin.

And yet they still expect us to have meetings with our advisors about the fall classes before we are allowed to sign up. On top of that, I have 2 advisors now, because of course. I was supposed to meet with both. Thankfully, I managed to get one to rubber stamp me through, so I only have one meeting to make before I can actually sign up.

This has got to be a new low. I can't imagine we're losing profs fast enough to just up and cancel a whole bunch of classes. That's insane. Also, a week late? C'mon guys.

Anyways, I found one class to sub in, but none of the others are looking like halfway decent fits. I guess I'll see what happens on Monday when I go to sign up.
