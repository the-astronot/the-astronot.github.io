Song of the Day: [**Flagpole Sitta**](https://youtu.be/wYsMjEeEg4g) - *Harvey Danger*

Last day of classes before spring break!

Wrapped everything up so I can have a chill week. Found an error in the code for camera calibration from the checkerboard method. I patched it quickly, but I intend to go back and make a more permanent fix so that I don't have to run the calibration multiple times in case of an I/O error.

Late tonight, I reopened Project-Atlas, which will be my pet project over break. I added a tensioner to the x-axis so that I can get away with not making custom belts, and hooked my new belt on there. I hope to try some soldering for the stepper motors tomorrow and then I can have two degrees of freedom rotation. I am hoping to leverage the software for the star mapper to cheat some of the math that my original plan was going to have to use.
