Song of the Day: [**Have You Ever Seen The Rain**](https://youtu.be/u1V8YRJnr4Q) - *Creedence Clearwater Revival*

In this week's continuing focus on hardware, I spent the day finishing printing the sleds for the nodes of my cluster computer and soldering the controller circuit to perfboard for the telescope.

I did the latter while marathoning Iron Man 1 & 2. As the first time soldering to perfboard, I think it went okay. Definitely not something I am racing to do again. I had a number of rough connections and accidental connections that I spent far too long fixing.

Here's the finished product:

Afterwards, I tested the motors using both controllers and completed successful tests.

I finished the night by planning out where on my pegboard the different components are going to end up.
