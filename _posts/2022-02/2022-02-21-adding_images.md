**21 February, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Skeleton**](https://youtu.be/oAq-By5s1ZM) - *The Front Bottoms*

Didn't get up to much today...

I had to spend most of it figuring out what a loop invariant is for my PSoft HW due tomorrow night. Luckily, I think I've got a handle on it now. Now all I have to do is figure out Dafny tomorrow. Wish me luck.

In other news, I realized that my picture from last night was the first and only actual image of myself on here, and I thought I would try and rectify that.

Here's me last spring, which I spent working at Home Depot:

And here's me and my roommates trying to force a metal Milwaukee workbench I semi-impulse bought at the Home Depot up a flight of stairs. (I had to return it, I'm still upset):

And finally, a shot of me seconds before disaster, captured through Alessandro's old film camera:
