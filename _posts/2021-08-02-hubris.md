It has been a very long day, but I guess that's what I deserve for my blatantly incorrect assumption that I had this all in hand.
My print for the KM Switch finished this morning, and I decided that I'd have it all wired up by the end of the day. That did not occur.
In the future I'll have to take more care removing terminals from PCBs, as I managed to clip a number of the connections to the female usb a too close to the body of the terminals, and as such, was greatly inconvenienced in my attempts to solder new leads to them. In the end, I tried to make the best connections I could, and surround the connections with hot glue.
This was not the worst, and I managed to get everything attached, but every time I managed to get it all in the case, I found that my connectivity tests yielded false negative responses, and I was forced to disassemble and reassemble the device.
I have new terminals coming in later this week, and hope that they will fare better.
