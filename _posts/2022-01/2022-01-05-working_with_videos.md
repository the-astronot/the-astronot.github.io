Song of the Day: [**Hand of Doom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNIgt6yKgDM) - *Black Sabbath*

Today I spent some time working more on my terminal tv project. Seeing that Vinny doesn't seem to be interested in the project any more, I figured I might as well try and push the ball farther down the field. Currently put in some work trying to turn video files into a number of frames to be converted. Also preparing to strip the audio from the original files to be made into mp3 files. Then I'll have to make the player and everything, but that's where I'm at now.
