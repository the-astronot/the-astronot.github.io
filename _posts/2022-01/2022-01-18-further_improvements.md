Song of the Day: [**We Didn't Start the Fire**](https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g) - *Billy Joel*

After class today, I put in a bit of time on the terminal project.

Didn't get much accomplished, but I made a bit of progress towards what will likely be my last two improvements of the project for the near future. I introduced a new file type, which stores data about the available files by the same name, including their sizes, accompanying audio, and time into the video when they were last played.

With this data, I will be able to restart an episode where I left off if I so choose, and switch between "resolutions" on the fly during a video if multiple files are available.

Like I said, I didn't get a ton done on it, especially because I am essentially rewriting previous code for most of it. This will all definitely need a scrub to eliminate extraneous code and comment through some of the more confusing aspects, but I suspect that will be a problem for later in the week Max. I don't envy him.
