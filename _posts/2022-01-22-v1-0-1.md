Song of the Day: [**Yellow Ledbetter**](https://youtu.be/iYtBMgLfqKQ) - *Pearl Jam*

Today I finished my modifications to terminal_tv and launched v1.0.1...

Right after I launched v1.0.0 and realized I forgot to remove a bunch of garbage. Note to self: Don't Do That Again.

On the bright side, this is functionally the first time I've really ever fely comfortable enough to make a release out of any of my code. I think I might have done one when I made my file compressor, but I really didn't have a clue what I was doing. I guess I don't now either, but you know...

Anyways, I've had Pearl Jam stuck in my head all day, so enjoy that again. I tried learning the guitar intro during a break. That lick is pretty tricky.
