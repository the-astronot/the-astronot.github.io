Song of the Day: [**Come On Eileen**](https://youtu.be/GbpnAGajyMc) - *Dexys Midnight Runners*

Today, I attached a discord bot to the system, allowing the scraper to alert me if it comes across a listing that matches my requirements. My early testing has been promising, and I will run the program overnight in the hope that further tests will prove fruitful.

Again, I won't really have a dedicated machine to run this on over the summer, but at least I will have it available to me in the future beyond it.
