Song of the Day: [**Sloom**](https://youtu.be/FubvitXV_zM) - *Of Monsters And Men*

Site is up!

Facelift complete! I really wasn't sure whether GitHub Pages would actually let the JS slide, so I am very glad that this wasn't all for naught.

Today, other than pushing the repo, I also made some fixes to the way some of the commands work. Hopefully the terminal should be functioning slightly more like a bash terminal now. I've also attempted to reduce the number of site-breaking phenomena to some local minimum.

I also augmented my CSS files with some jquery in my js setup to regulate the height of the terminal, because that was all over the place. One step closer to actually knowing something about javascript. My biggest fears are being realized.
