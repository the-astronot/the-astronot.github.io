Song of the Day: [**Feed the Machine**](https://youtu.be/Y4HVJvTGbkc) - *Poor Mans Poison*

Been a while...

Managed to complete 2 steps of my 3 part move. I have moved all of my things from my old apartment in Troy into the new one across campus. From there, I have also brought some things home, along with some stuff to bring with me to Houston. I've got myself settled in for the week, and hopefully I'll be able to find some projects to work on over that time.

Unfortunately, things being as they are, it would appear that I will be unable to make any additional progress on my homelab until I can return to Troy. I suppose I'll just have to find other things to occupy my curiosity.
