Song of the Day: [**Majestic**](https://youtu.be/4B6E0mijV5A) - *Wax Fang*

After a few days off dealing with other things, we're back in action.

I managed to design myself an alternate y-axis motor setup, transferring the poorly functioning belt-as-a-gear design for an actual belt and gear setup. I haven't been able to do much testing or other planning for it, as I seem to have misplaced one of my GT2 belts, but the new stuff looks pretty good to me, at least as a prototype.

I'll likely have to go and re-print a lot of this later on, but at least I'll know that the theory is sound.

And yeah, I'm putting up Majestic again, but its a great song.
