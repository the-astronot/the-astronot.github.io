Song of the Day: [**G.O.A.T.**](https://youtu.be/9_gkpYORQLU) - *Polyphia*

Slow week, I know.

Unfortuantely, with all of the cleaning, packing up, and trying to spend a few last moments with some college friends, it has not been a very productive week for the telescope project. I am not happy about it, but it is what it is.

Today however, while sorting out some other computer issues, I managed to pivot my linux distribution to be operating off of my new R620 server. I had been running a 2 desktop setup, with a linux pc getting a monitor, a windows pc getting another, and transitioning back and forth between the two for the final remaining one. While not terrible, it isn't excellent either. I even had a whole bit of trying to share the mouse an keybaord. I can't believe that was already last summer's project. Crazy how time goes by.

Anyways, I have now loaded an installation of Ubuntu onto the server and managed to finagle a home version of RealVNC into allowing be access to it via their cloud system, meaning that I am able to access it wherever I am. I currently sit on my couch in my living room, writing this post on the server itself. Hopefully I'll get a chance tomorrow to get off of this network and attempt to access it again, to make sure that I was successful.

That's about it. I wouldn't expect much in the way of hardware updates for a while, as I won't be able to bring my tools to Houston, so it seems that it will be a summer of software. Maybe I'll finally get into some web-dev, or maybe some cybersecurity or something. Who knows, maybe NASA will kick the shit out of me and I won't want to code outside of the office? Wouldn't that be interesting.

Speaking of which, I will hopefully be putting out posts day by day off all that I get up to down there for the summer, provided that I'm not doing anything secret that would violate my NDA.
