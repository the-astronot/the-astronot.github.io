Song of the Day: [**King Of The Kingdom Of Man**](https://youtu.be/EevTILISjuU) - *Wax Fang*

Continuing on, I have decided this site is **boring**.

Up until today, I thought that GitHub Pages only served static sites, so I had been using vanilla jekyll for the whole site. Today though, I came across some people doing some more interesting stuff, and decided I wanted to join them.

I give you, [**my new landing page!**](/index.html)

Yes, I am a massive nerd. I have created a faux bash terminal as my landing page. It's cool though, I swear. Or at least, I think it's cool. And that's all I care about.

I can't take full credit for it though. I ended up basing it on [jquery.terminal](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal) (I don't actually know javascript, I just guess at how it should work and get lucky).

Regardless, it exists now, and I think it is way cooler than my old landing page.

I do take credit for the faux file structure that I store as a json object. I'm hoping to finish that up tomorrow.
