Song of the Day: [**Hoist Up The Thing**](https://youtu.be/SaEXyQg7pCc) - *The Longest Johns*

**IT'S OVER!**

School is out for the summer, and I have never been so happy for it. This semester has been a rough one. A lot of tough classes that held very little interest for me.

**Java has been removed from all computers.**

After finishing up my final meeting, I added some more changes to the terminal prompt on this site. I am really enjoying adding really completely unnecessary commands that I imagine no one will ever use.

This time around, I modified the ls and cd commands to work as they would in a regular bash terminal, i.e. allowing multiple folders at a time. I've also added the hostname and pwd commands, just because they were easy, and I could.
