Song of the Day: [**Art School Wannabe**]() - *Sorority Noise*

Finally found time to implement some modifications to the images on this site. I've been meaning to optimize them, as they have grown quite large and take a while to load. So, today I wrote a script that leverages the cwebp program to convert all of the images to .webp files.

To the best of my (admittedly lacking) knowledge, webp format files will be smaller and therfore allow for faster loading. My new challenge is finding a way to conveniently replace all of the previous links in posts and projects with the new .webp links.
