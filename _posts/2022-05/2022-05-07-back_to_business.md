Song of the Day: [**Hard Times for the Revolution**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y9FHHl6I0I) - *Ross Rice*

Today, after catching up on all the sleep I've missed over the last semester, I started thinking about picking my telescope project back up. I'd ideally like to have it done before commencement, but I realize that that is likely a bit of a pipe dream. Still though, I'd like to make as much progress as I can on it before I have to head down to Houston, where I won't be able to work on it. From my assessment, the all of the following has to get done before I have half a chance of getting some star pics:

1. Check my circuitry I did during spring break. Make sure its still functioning.
2. Design and print a free-spinning gear for the extra tensioner. The current cylinder isn't doing the job.
3. Rediesign, print, and assemble a better main mirror holder. The current one simply will not do.
4. Design and print a mount for the camera/lens/etc.
5. Write a simple motor control library and testing script.
6. Obtain a long enough camera cable to connect the camera and Pi.
7. Dial in mirrors (have a chat with Austin)
8. Figure out how to put the Pi into bridge mode to act as a wireless access point so that I can connect to it without a network (chat with Anthony)

Hopefully I should be able to get started on all of it come tomorrow.
