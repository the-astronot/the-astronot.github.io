Song of the Day: [**Art School Wannabe**](https://youtu.be/czEjLM9b6VM) - *Sorority Noise*

Still no luck with the catalogs, despite adding a new image set to my analysis. My mentor was kind enough to generate me a new image set that covered a large portion of the celestial sphere to use for my investigations, so that I wouldn't have to rely on the others, which each use less than 7% of the sky.

He also pointed out that the reference frame transformations that we I have been using to map the attitude quaternions to Right Ascension/Declination/Rotation have forgotten to take into account the modified camera reference frame. This will require an extra reference frame shift in the calculations, which I will have to add in the coming days.
