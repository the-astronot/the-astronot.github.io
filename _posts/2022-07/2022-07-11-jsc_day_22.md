Song of the Day: [**These Days**](https://youtu.be/YDVAQI-4lto) - *Foo Fighters*

Back in the office!

I ended up dropping the jpeg decoder for the time being while we try and get access to some specifications documentation. So, I went back to the image analyzer for the celestial sphere. I worked out the math required to warp the images over the poles accurately, which ended up looking pretty cool.

Of course, as soon as I had done that, I realized that for the rest of the map to be accurate, I'd have to do the math to accurately warp **all** of the images. That was easier said than done. I left work today still mulling over the geometry.
