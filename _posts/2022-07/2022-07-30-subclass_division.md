Song of the Day: [**Square Hammer**]() - *Ghost*

Today, I expanded on the work I started yesterday. I ended up pulling the assorted subclasses out of the one filestructures file and gave them each their own python file for sack of clarity, readability, and expandability. I also added in logic for bash files, and "copying" files that already exist.

Having used the codebase to add 2 filetypes today, I would say that I am pretty happy with the rewrite, and that adding more filetypes as needed should take only minimal effort to get set up.
