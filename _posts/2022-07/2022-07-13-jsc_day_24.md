Song of the Day: [**Crumbling Castle**](https://youtu.be/uLP8rFrL1W0) - *King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard*

So my scraper ran into some issues overnight, and I had to perform a small re-write this morning to deal with the timeouts I was experiencing. This was my first time using the solely the requests module, as the site allowed the option to return dat as pure ascii text. It went surprisingly well, overall.

After that, I ended up doing some data analysis by hand for one of the smaller 40 image datasets, to try and get a hand on what to expect when we start removing star data from the system. Surprisingly (to me at least), the stars used were spread fairly equally across the range of proper-motion stars. I'm starting to wonder how much good this analysis will do for us. Hopefully, as we start removing stars from the catalog, new lower-proper motion stars will be used in their place.

In addition, I cleaned up some of my area mapping code, as it had grown a little wild over all of the recurring changes I had made to it. I'm still not wicked happy with how it ended up, but I have come to the conclusion that it is good enough for now and that I can return to the issue should I finish the remainder of my work for the end of the summer.
