Song of the Day: [**Lonely Day**](https://youtu.be/DnGdoEa1tPg) - *System of a Down*

Finished up the week by trying to get the bitstream running with the huffman table. Some of the data looks promising, but I end up with errors when codes can't be found in the huffman table. Without access to proper documentation for the JPEG encoding/decoding standard, there's not a whole lot else I can do to debug/figure out what it is I'm doing wrong. Hopefully when I get back into the office on Monday I can figure out whether NASA has some way of obtaining scientific papers/ISO standards.
