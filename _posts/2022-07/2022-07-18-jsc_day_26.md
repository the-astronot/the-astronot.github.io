Song of the Day: [**High Hopes**](https://youtu.be/7jMlFXouPk8) - *Pink Floyd*

Back at it. Started writing up some documentation for the code I finished up on Thursday. I also started prepping the slides for presenting the tool to the EG2 group next Wednesday.

Around doing my usual stuff, I took a look at some code for a friend, and we worked out a more efficient and edge-case-less method for accomplishing what he was trying to do.
