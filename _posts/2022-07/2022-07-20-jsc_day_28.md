Song of the Day: [**Best of You**](https://youtu.be/h_L4Rixya64) - *Foo Fighters*

Today, I worked out the math required to calculate the lifetimes of my modified catalogs my program generates. Right now, it's looking like by removing the first 1000 stars from the catalog, I can extend the lifetime of the catalog from only 1 year to 4.5. I think that is pretty cool. I also put some more work into my exit presentation. I can't believe how quickly this time has passed, and it feels so weird making the slides up to finish the summer.
