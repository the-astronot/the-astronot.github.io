Song of the Day: [**Come As You Are**](https://youtu.be/vabnZ9-ex7o) - *Nirvana*

Continued working with the Mini today, trying to get opencv installed. It's looking like i'm going to have to try and build up a number of the utilities from source. Obviously, I'd like to avoid that if I can, but for the moment it's looking like the only option available to me.

**EDIT:** Spent the second half of my day constructing the single jankiest setup I have ever conceived. I realized that the Mini allows for Network Sharing, which lets me to connect my "ethernet only" desktop to it and pass-through the wifi connection. This has allowed me to move my rig out of the den and into my room. Now I don't need to worry about bothering anyone with my mechanical keyboard, and I can click in peace. I just wish it didn't look so abhorrent, I'll have to remember to upload a picture later.
