Song of the Day: [**Santeria**](https://youtu.be/AEYN5w4T_aM) - *Sublime*

Another day spent trying to figure out why changing the catalog out for an older one doesn't seem to affect our ability to determine the attitude for an image set. By all logic that I can work out, we should be seeing some degradation in the determination when setting the catalog time back to the mid-2000s. By all the calculations I've come across, the stars we are using should have moved some distance over that period and therefore not be recognized by our star identification scripts.

Around doing that, I also updated the graphs for my presentation to the OpNav group on Wednesday.
