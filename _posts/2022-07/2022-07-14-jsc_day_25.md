Song of the Day: [**Ramble On**](https://youtu.be/LzGBQerkvWs) - *Led Zeppelin*

What a great day.

In the morning, I was able to attend a talk given by Gene Kranz, the Flight Ops Director for the Apollo 11 and 13 missions. It was pretty cool to hear him speak about the Apollo days and to have him wish us luck with the Artemis.

I was even lucky enough to get a picture with him.

After that, I was able to fully implement the star removal code for my project. I'm really proud of myself for being able to figure it out, as it required sifting through many complex data structures across thousands of lines of code with which I have familiarized myself without any assistance. On top of that, the early results from the dataset I processed confirmed the hypothesis that I had come in trying to prove. It looks like we can stand to lose quite a few high proper motion stars from the catalog without it drastically hindering the effectiveness of the catalog for the purpose of attitude determination.
