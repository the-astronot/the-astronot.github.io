Song of the Day: [**Sad Statue**](https://youtu.be/5XAK_My0zaw) - *System of a Down*

Another day of work on the jpeg reader. Admittedly, I spent a good portion of it just looking around for some kind of documentation for how the main bytestream is encode and written to the file. Surprisingly (to me at least), there exists a great deal of literature out there concerning encoding jpegs, but not so much on the finer details of decoding them.

Thankfully, I **was** able to write up a poor excuse for a stream reader and confirm that I was able to read in data bit by bit. While finishing up, I believe I have also finally come across a decent answer to how the AC and DC values of each block are encoded, specifically, which should allow me to write-up some code tomorrow morning to accomplish that.
