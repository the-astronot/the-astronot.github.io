Song of the Day: [**Atlas, Rise**](https://youtu.be/JFAcOnhcpGA) - *Metallica*

I never managed to find a perfect solution to my geometry problem, so instead I implemented a piece-wise function of my two separate techniques for the equator and the poles. I'm not wicked proud of this, but I spent too much time trying to get it to work, and I have other stuff to do. Moving onward, I wrote a bit of code to output all of the star ids from our Hipparcos catalog, and wrote another script to scrape the [SIMBAD](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr) website for the proper-motion for those stars. Tomorrow, I'll sort the stars by proper-motion. Once I have that sorted, I can start trying to run the software with fewer and fewer high proper-motion stars in the catalog
