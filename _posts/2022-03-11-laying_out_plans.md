Song of the Day: [**Little Talks**](https://youtu.be/ghb6eDopW8I) - *Of Monsters and Men*

I began today by removing everything from the pegboard and bringing it out back to cut some holes for cable runs. Afterwards, I put everything back, as well as mounting the fans are beginning the cable runs.

After that, I designed and printed a housing for the circuit I made last night. I got lucky, as it only required the one iteration to obtain a functioning enclosure.
