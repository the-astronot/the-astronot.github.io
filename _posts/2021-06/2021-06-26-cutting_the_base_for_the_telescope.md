So... I took a few days off when I discovered Mortal Kombat for the first time, but today I set up the sawhorses in my backyard and got to work cutting out a base for my telecope.
With a little help from my parents holding all the different pieces, I managed to cut up one of my 3/4" plywood sheets and fasten the pieces together into a kind of box that will carry the main section of my telescope. I also drilled out the holes and mounted the bolts and ball bearing in it for the telescope carriage to ride along.
All in all, it was a good day to be back to work.
