My [arduino micro](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-micro) came in tonight, and I was able to quickly swap it out for the one I had. Once that was done, I uploaded the code I had written, and it worked immediately!
I spent the rest of the night playing [Mortal Kombat 11](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976310/Mortal_Kombat11/), [Street Fighter V](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310950/Street_Fighter_V/), and making minor tweaks allowing me to try out other 2D games like [Dead Cells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/) and [Risk of Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain/).
In doing so, I realized that treating the stick as a keyboard was not necessarily in my best interest, as most games are made with controller support, and pre-map the buttons to be able to be played with the ~10 switches you'd find on an Xbox 360 controller, which works out well, sice that is what I have as well.
Going forward, I'm looking at switching my program from using keyboard input to using a library that makes the hardware be recognized as a controller.
