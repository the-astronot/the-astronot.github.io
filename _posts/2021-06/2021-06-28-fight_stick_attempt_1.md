Today, I received the last of the parts I needed to construct my diy fight stick out of an arduino and some arcade parts I found on the internet.
All was going well constructing the rough test out of the box the parts came in, before I realized that setting up a simple serial connection wasn't going to cut it. But, as I learned, to use the arduino keyboard library, you need to have one of a few specific arduino models that allows itself to be used as a HID device.

Due to this, I was forced to purchase a new arduino micro off of amazon and anxiously await its arrival.
