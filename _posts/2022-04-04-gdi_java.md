Song of the Day: [**Saint Bernard**](https://youtu.be/AGeLUXNl--0) - *Lincoln*

I got all that work done yesterday, and it was all going so well...

When I went to pass it in to the autograder, my code failed, with the system incapable of asllocating the required memory. After waaaaaay too much time spent trying to figure out why tha was happening (works on my machine, java is supposed to do its own garbage collection), I realized that the source was the static function I was using to read data from the .csv file. When I went to write that part of the code, eclipse yelled at me to use the function statically, without creating an instance of the class. The unfortuante downside of that is that (to the best of my understanding) all of the data used by it is essentially treated as being static itself, which added up QUICK when the autograder was churning out a bunch of different graphs to test.

I continue to be overhwelmingly excited to never touch this language ever again.
