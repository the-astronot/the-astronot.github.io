Song of the Day: [**Welcome to the Internet**](https://youtu.be/k1BneeJTDcU) - *Bo Burnham*

I finally understand NGINX! I've been trying to understand how to serve my static jekyll site on my server (separate for github). Due to some misunderstandings, I was never able to quite get it, and in the past had reverted to simply calling `bundle exec jekyll serve` and leaving it at that.

I also spent some time (unsuccessfully) attempting to create an ssh tunnel to my main server from the larger internet. I'm still trying to create such a tunnel, or barring that, a larger VPN into my homelab network so that I can access my code server from class.
