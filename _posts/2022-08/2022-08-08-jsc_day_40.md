Song of the Day: [**We All Lift Together**](https://youtu.be/JBjCPYgYrrg) - *The Longest Johns*

Gave my exit presentation today. It went surprisingly well! I'm very happy with myself.

I really enjoyed being able to show off all of my summer projects to other members of the EG team. Unfortunately, that's the end of my work for the summer, and these last few days, I've essentially entered a lame duck period. I will continue adding documentation to the assorted projects for my last few days, but I don't consider that worthy of any additional posts.

So, for all intents and purposes, this marks the end of my time at JSC this summer. It's been a hell of a ride, and I won't soon forget it.
