Song of the Day: [**Space Oddity**](https://youtu.be/iYYRH4apXDo) - *David Bowie*

Today, I had my dry-run ahead of my exit presentation next week. Definitely could have gone worse. I was also able to attend a lecture by Fred Haise, one of the astronauts from Apollo 13. All in all, a pretty crazy day. We also started looking into whether my main program for the summer, my star catalog analysis, should be taking into consideration the ability to calibrate off of star images. Adding functionality to allow checking for calibration potential would add another dimension to the analysis and hopefully provide us with some more detailed information on the system as a whole.
