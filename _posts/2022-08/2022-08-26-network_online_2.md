Song of the Day: [**Lover of the Light**](https://youtu.be/nMJUbZrNnA8) - *Mumford and Sons*

Today, I set up and took down my network multiple times. I realized that, try as I might, I just couldn't stand the sound of the 1U networking switch at all times. I now see how the Juniper EX-3200 got its reputation as a data-center-only piece of hardware.

I also made the mistake of putting the pi-hole required by the network on my server, which takes a long time to reboot, essentially downing the wireless network in the meantime.
