Song of the Day: [**Hello My Old Heart**](https://youtu.be/pcB_6VHmP64) - *The Oh Hellos*

Today, I resolved my JPEG reader difficulties via the addition of open-source software. I found a library that reads jpegs, pngs, etc, while being contained within a single C header file. Unfortunately, this disqualifies the code from being considered flight software, as open-source code will not be trusted when the lives of astronauts are at stake, this will allow the OpNav group to perform tests on their software with JPEGs and PNGs. It also opens up the option for use with less high-risk endeavors, such as cubesats and the like. And all of this integrated in less than 20 lines of code.
