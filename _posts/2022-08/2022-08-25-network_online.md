Song of the Day: [**The Boxer**](https://youtu.be/YAl-vZsswb4) - *Mumford and Sons*

Well, yesterday I assembled the physical infrastructure for the lab, today I threw together the network to run it all on.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of physical access to the modem/router, I've has to resume my use of what I am now referring to as the "Houston Connection". I have the Mac Mini connected to the main wifi, using that to pass internet through to the rest of my devices. I've attached my own router to the system as well to serve as an access point. I realize that I'm probably breaking every networking rule in the book with this, but it is what it is. I should have some more equipment coming in early next week to get rid of this issue.
