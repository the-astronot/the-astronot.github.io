Song of the Day: [**World War II, Part 2**](https://youtu.be/51wZem-UwPI) - *Wax Fang*

I decided it was about time I changed my handle. I don't feel that the old one applies any longer. So, today's goal was to change that out.

After a lot of back and forth, I ended up with "the-astronot", as both the .com and github account were available, and I like the puns I can get out of it.

Now I'm working on getting all of the github and website stuff switched over. Luckily, I came to this decision before I set up my homelab at school, or else this would require a lot more work. As it is, there is a lot of data to modify.
