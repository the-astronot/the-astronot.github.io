Song of the Day: [**Soldier, Poet, King**](https://youtu.be/sOv0hENoQnE) - *The Oh Hellos*

I did some more work adding calibration determination capability to SKYAN. I'm still hitting a few hiccups trying to get it to work properly, but that is to be expected working with such a large and unfamiliar codebase.

Aside from that, thanks to my mentor I have gained access to the JPEG Standards so that I might try and debug the issues I had been encountering with my JPEG reader. At the moment, I'm not seeing any real issues that I should be running into according to the document, but I will continue to try and figure out what the issues are.
