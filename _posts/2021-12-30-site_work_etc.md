**30 December, 2021**

Spent way too much time and effort reworking how the images page of the site works.

However, it works now, and should be fairly well optimized across varying screen widths. I am very excited to not look at CSS again for a little while.

In other news, now that I've got a bit of money on me, I've decided to try and finish up my fight stick. Since the summer, while it has been functional, it has also been operating out of the cardboard box that the parts arrived in. Today, I swung by Woodcraft and picked up some wood and a can of stain. Greg has also very kindly offered the use of his shop on Saturday to try and get as much of it done as possible, so I have that to look forward to.

Will certainly post some pictures of it as the work comes together.
