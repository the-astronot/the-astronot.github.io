Song of the Day: [**I'm Still Standing**](https://youtu.be/ZHwVBirqD2s) - *Elton John*

So glad I reached the end of the week. It was a long one. My FDL report did not go the way I wanted it to, and it threw off the rest of my week. On the bright side, I finally got around to actually setting my pi up after helping Alessandro and Austin with theirs on Monday. In doing so, I managed to run all of my gui through VNC, including the PiCamera test window, which took some doing. I have to admit, when the software is expecting headless setups, I do not know why they would have certain required setting only available through the gui of a display connected to the system. All in all though, the system is set up and ready for calibration in the coming week. Here's hoping for favorable weather for capturing images of stars.
