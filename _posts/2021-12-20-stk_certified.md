**20 December, 2021**

So, I didn't actually make much progress on the cluster computer today. However, I ironed out some bugs for the modifications I am making to posts here, and I received the STK Level 1 certification that I took the test to apply for yesterday. I'm looking to continuing through the levels of certification for it. It's a pretty cool technology.
