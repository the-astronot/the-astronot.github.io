# Overview
With this commit, I should have ironed out most of the worst looking parts of this site. I'm still trying to decide how to format and what to include in the README.md file, as well as how best to incorporate images.

**Added**
- psuedo-code landing page
- Related and Posts attributes of project pages
- README file is no longer blank, not sure its gonna stay the way it is
- Resume added to site
- Started to fill out other projects
