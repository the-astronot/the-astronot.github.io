**PROJECT(s):** None

Song of the Day: [**The Flower of Inverness**](https://youtu.be/T78Ov4_FxZY) - *The Irish Rovers*

I made it! I am so glad to be through last week. After finishing up all of my assignments, I finally feel like I can take a breather. Plus, I was wicked productive today in getting my next OpSys HW done, so it looks like I should even have time this week to put in some hours on my master's project and stay in my advisor's good graces.

On a sadder note, my interview did not go as well as I had hoped. The day of, I ran into a number of last second changes I was not at all prepared for. Considering the circumstances, I think I performed as well as could be expected, but without the context I can see how my interviewers wouldn't necessarily be thrilled with me. I'm still hopeful it might work out, but I am definitely less sure of myself then I was last week.
