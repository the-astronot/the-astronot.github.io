Day 3:

Well, today was an interesting one. It definitely took some turns that I wasn't expecting.

There was an extra seat available in a training for the guys in EG2 concerning Spatial Analyzer, a cool piece of software for working with total stations, theodolites, laser measuring devices, etc. So I was invited to join in. I for one was very surprised that anything I'd done while working for the City of Woburn (namely being introduced to the total station) would actually be put to use. But here I was, confidently asserting that I had some experience with the technology at hand, much to the surprise of the trainer.

So I spent the day in the class and the lab, learning to use the software as well as to incorporate it with the hardware that we had.

Interestingly (to me at least), we seem to be some of the last actual users of [theodolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite), an instrument I only just learned about today. For this reason, very little documentation existed for using the software with them. This led to a great deal of trial and error, exasperation, and standing around.

I did manage to learn a fair bit about the instruments, which I am happy about.

By far the oddest experience I've had in a while was the trip to lunch, wherein I crammed myself into the back of my boss's 2000 toyota sienna alongside the trainer and two other co-workers and drove through the gate to a Jimmy Johns around the corner, all to the sound of Madonna's [Like a Prayer](https://youtu.be/79fzeNUqQbQ). It was just a very odd situation to find myself in, and I found myself asking what I had done to lead me there.
