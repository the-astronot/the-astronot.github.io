Day 4:

Continuing the training.

Today's was largely focused on taking measurements with the theodolites and managing them within Spatial Analyzer. By the end of the day, we had managed to work out most of the kinks.

I also finally got my hands on my laptop! Still a lot required for me to actually get to work on my code, but I am one step closer.
