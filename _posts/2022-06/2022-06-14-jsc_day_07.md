Song of the Day: [**Sultans of Swing**](https://youtu.be/0fAQhSRLQnM) - *Dire Straits*

Likely the last day for the time being working with Spatial Analyzer. We have documentation up through creating 2 mirror cubes with 4 separate theodolite instances as well as generating the reports to go along with them. This seems like a logical endpoint, after which the user should have the knowledge required to accomplish whatever their more specific goal might be.

In the afternoon, I was able to get a camera mounted on the gimbal and drive the system using the code I'll be modifying. Thankfully the codebase seems solid and shouldn't take too much modification to change to suit the new camera. Unfortunately, the deadlines for having these calibrations ready to be sent onwards are rapidly approaching, and it seems I'll be working on this full-time for the next while.

If I should ever find some free time however, I have been introduced to another smaller project, one that I would be developing in full, from scratch, which has me excited. Post-mission, the OpNav guys want to get some idea of how much of the celestial sphere was actually used for navigation. It's interesting data that we just don't have a method for obtaining at the moment. So basically, they want me to make it. I'm currently formulating some ideas about how I want to tackle it. I'll probably write more on that tomorrow, once the plans are more concrete.
