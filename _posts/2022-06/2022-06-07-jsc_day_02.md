Song of the Day: [**Seven Seas of Rhye**](https://youtu.be/FxIo57WURRE) - *Queen*

Day 2:

Managed to actually get badged. Still waiting for my laptop and computer access, but I have been given some idea of what I will be working on, at least in the short term. I have been given the task of modifying existing code in order to calibrate the docking camera that will be used on the next Orion mission.

**Pretty damn cool.**
