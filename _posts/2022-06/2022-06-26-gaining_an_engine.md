Song of the Day: [**Hammer to Fall**](https://youtu.be/JU5LMG3WFBw) - *Queen*

I managed to get a decent start going on the project yesterday, and today I decided that it would be cool to add some extra functionality to said library. To this extent, I began writing up a framework for a VERY basic game engine to store some variables and push some frames.

In addition to that, I have made a testing folder, in which I will attempt to use my library to remake old games. First up, I have decided, will be Pacman.

Here is a very early image of the terminal (yes, I know that literally nothing is right, bear with me)
