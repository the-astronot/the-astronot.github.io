Song of the Day: [**For Whom The Bell Tolls**](https://youtu.be/eeqGuaAl6Ic) - *Metallica*

Came into the office today to realize that password authentication had been disabled on our servers. Apparently this has been planned for a while, but obviously I knew nothing about it.

I spent the first half of the day trying to regin access to the servers so that I could download some code to work on. I never actually managed to do so, but rather I discovered that VS Code allows for working remotely over ssh. I sent an ssh key over to the server and then used it to authenticate my VS Code session. That made my life way easier. Now I can fully develop on linux, rather than having to try and move things back and forth between the server and my laptop.

I spent the latter half of the day looking over the OpNav codebase and planning out which functions I am going to use for my current assignment. I'm back to trying to determine which stars are actually being used by the attitude determination software in an effort to try and pare down the number of stars in our catalog.
