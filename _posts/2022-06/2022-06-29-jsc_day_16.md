Song of the Day: [**Aces High**](https://youtu.be/Xg9aQvjMS60) - *Iron Maiden*

After a tag-up with my mentor where I got a better idea of how I should be going about writing the utility, I set to work programming the star catalog analyzer. By the afternoon, I had worked up a C++ script to load images and request attitude quaternions/star ids from the opnav codebase.

It was all going pretty well until it came time for me to transfer the attitude quaternions into Roll/Pitch/Yaw so that I could use my earlier python scripts to plot the frames and analyze the amount of the celestial sphere that was used. My mentor gave me some matlab scripts to perform the conversion, and I started converting them into C++, but I haven't actually been able to get them to work correctly with my script.

I ended up staying pretty late trying to get that conversion to work, but no dice. I'll have to give it another shot in the morning.
