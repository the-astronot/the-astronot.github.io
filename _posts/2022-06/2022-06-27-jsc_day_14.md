Song of the Day: [**Hopeless Wanderer**](https://youtu.be/rId6PKlDXeU) - *Mumford and Sons*

Well, I finally figured out what the HOTH is. Had to go over there today to give my mentor a hand showing the calibration for the DCAM to the Lockheed Martin guys. Ended up spending most of my day there after helping Steve pack everything up and ship it all over there.

I was blown away by their lab. I cannot believe the sheer amount of power they must blow through, between all of their server racks and the simulation equipment for Artemis I and II.

Hoping I'll get to spend a bit more time in there while I'm down here for the summer. With the camera set up, I'm not sure I'll have an excuse to get back in there, but we will see.
