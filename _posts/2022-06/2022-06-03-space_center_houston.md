Song of the Day: [**Planet Caravan**](https://youtu.be/bTwT3tKPuMY) - *Black Sabbath*

Eagle has landed!

Had a crazy day at Space Center Houston! I'm still having a hard time believing some of the things that I saw there. The sheer size and scale of the infrastructure they have there is staggering.

My dad took my picture outside of the JSC sign next door. ![jsc_sign](/assets/images/jsc_sign.webp) It's finally hitting me that I'm going to be working down here for the summer, and I am so excited to get started!

I threw some more photos and descriptions under a [space_center_houston](/random/space_center_houston) file under the [random](/random) tab
