Day 5:

Today we attempted to cobble together a guide to using Spatial Analyzer for our theodolites from what we learned over the past 2 days. This time however, we did not have the Hexagon trainer there to help us out.

It went surprisingly well! We made some minor miss-steps along the way, but by the end of the day, we had a process enumerated that allowed the reader to recreate our setup with 2 theodolites and a mirror cube of their own.

After we finished our run through, I went back to trying to get my laptop software installed. That did not go as well. After a call to tech support, I came to the realization that the organization recently increased the security levels required to gain escalated priviledges, seemingly to the point where I would not be able to obtain the ability during my time here to actually install the software required to fulfill my role as a programmer.

I guess I'll have to have a conversation with someone on Monday as to how I should be getting around that.
