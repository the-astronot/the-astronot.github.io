Song of the Day: [**Dirty Paws**](https://youtu.be/mCHUw7ACS8o) - *Of Monsters and Men*

Started a new project to keep me busy in the absence of tools or networking equipment. I want to take the lessons learned from my [tv_terminal](/projects/terminal_tv) project and use them to create a sort of ascii "graphics" library for the bash shell. The idea here being that I could reuse this library for other projects rather than have to reinvent the wheel each time.

I really enjoy that the repo name could be read as "graphic shell" or "graphics hell", as I both will accurately describe this project.
