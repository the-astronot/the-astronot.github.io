Song of the Day: [**All Along The Watchtower**](https://youtu.be/TLV4_xaYynY) - *Jimi Hendrix*

First day of the trip down to Houston. We managed to make it all the way down into Tennessee. 15 hour trip. Another big one tomorrow.

Somewhere along the way I somehow remembered not incrementing a variable in my script modifiecations from yesterday. Sure enough, when I pulled out my laptop at the end of the day, the incrementation did not exist. Added it and pushed the commit. Should **actually** actually work now.
