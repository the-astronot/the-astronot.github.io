Song of the Day: [**Hocus Pocus**](https://youtu.be/g4ouPGGLI6Q) - *Focus*

First day at JSC!

It was a rough one.

Whole bunch of technical issues, my mentor couldn't be there, it was a long day. I am excited for the days to come though, hoping they will get better.

I did get a chance to get into the SAIL (Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory) and sit in the Space Shuttle simulacrum, so, that was pretty cool.
