Song of the Day: [**Rock You Like A Hurricane**](https://youtu.be/6yP1tcy9a10) - *Scorpions*

Started planning out a new project. Down here in Houston, I'm itching to get my hands on some hardware again. I just picked up a patch panel and poe gigabit router on ebay for cheap and have started trying to figure out how I am going to store my new equipment alongside my R620, Raspberry Pis, etc.

Server racks are not as expensive as I would have imagined, but I am looking to gain some kind of noise reduction from the rack, particularly for the R620, and racks with that capability go for quite a bit more.

I am quite certain that with my skillsets and the tools at my disposal, I can design and manufacture a server rack with reasonable noise reduction capabilities. I have begun sketching and CADding up plans.
