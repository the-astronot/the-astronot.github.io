**22 June, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Goodbye Lulu**](https://youtu.be/mahZLt7Fpi0) - *Days N' Daze*

Pretty boring day. I ran into a number of bottlenecks for getting the DCAM software running on the Gimbal computer. I learned to use Visual Studio's solution files, as well as using and maneuvering through that software. I got held up by the system requiring libraries from opencv, for which we have a specialized version on my mentor's computer. Unfortunately, he is still off-site and the library is almost 11 GB in size.

We weren't able to complete the transfer today, hopefully I should be able to get them tomorrow morning.
