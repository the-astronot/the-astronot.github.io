Song of the Day: [**War Pigs**](https://youtu.be/bc5Nk1DXyEY) - *Black Sabbath*

Second week is already going better than the first! I met Jada, our IT lady, and she was able to get all of my software set up for me, which is awesome. So happy to be able to work on stuff from my laptop now.

Aside from that, Steve and I spent more time in the lab fleshing out the Spatial Analyzer documentation. I'm really surprised at how quickly I've been able to pick it up, and I think he is as well. I'm definitely feeling like I'm the point guy for SA in the office at this point.

Pretty cool.

Adding in some more images here, since it was a pretty quick day.

Here's the doors and sign to my lab, the EOL:

And here is the gimbal that I'm working with:
