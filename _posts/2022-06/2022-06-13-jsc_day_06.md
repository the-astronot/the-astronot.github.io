Song of the Day: [**War Pigs**](https://youtu.be/bc5Nk1DXyEY) - *Black Sabbath*

Second weeek is already going better than the first! I met Jada, our IT lady, and she was able to get all of my software set up for me, which is awesome. So happy to be able to work on stuff from my laptop now.

Aside from that, Steve and I spent more time in the lab fleshing out the Spatial Analyzer documentation. I'm really surprised at how quickly I've been able to pick it up, and I think he is as well. I'm definitely feeling like I'm the point guy for SA in the office at this point.

Pretty cool.
