Song of the Day: [**Start Wearing Purple**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6IJfo4q1zk) - *Gogol Bordello*

Didn't get up to too much today, but I found some pictures I hadn't uploaded, so I figured I'd spend today's post uploading them and giving them some context.

The first two come from my time working for RPI's Center for Earthquake Engineering Simulation. I spent the fall semester of 2020 and 2021 working as a computer and electrical systems assistant. In that capacity, I spent time developing code to automate the filling of experiment tanks with water, diagnosing errors with the centrifuge controller, and testing/calibrating assorted sensors.

The rest come from when I was originally assembling my cluster of single board computers (SBCs). These are the first images I've uploaded of the project as a piece of hardware, rather than software. The main section of the machine consists of a section of pegboard, affixed to which are both power supplies, both routers, and the vertical rods along which the SBCs are stacked.

Finally, I have an image of my screen while I was setting up all of the separate nodes simultaneously. I'm not entirely certain why, but having all of the separate terminals open was very gratifying, and it sticks out in my mind as the first time I actually felt like a programmer, rather than an engineer pretending to be one.
