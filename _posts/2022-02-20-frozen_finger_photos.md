Song of the Day: [**Aqualung**](https://youtu.be/B0jMPI_pUec) - *Jethro Tull*

Try 2 at starfield image capture was a success!

Alessandro and I took a ride down Hoosick out of Troy in search of a dark out of the way spot to try and get some better starfield images. We found just that in a long meandering path far removed from the rest of the city. Maybe a little **too** far removed...

Using the raspistill utility rather than the picamera implementation given to us by the NASA engineers, we were able to mess with the expsoure and shutter speed settings to acquire usable images.

Dear god was it cold out there. The wind was insane. I am so looking forward to doing this again come spring, and absolutely no sooner.

First attempt: Setting exposure mode to night

Second try: Setting shutter speed to 2000 ms

Third try: Setting shutter speed to 6000 ms

Alessandro also snapped this photo of me freezing to death at my keyboard, which I find hilarious.

Immediately after we finished getting calibration shots for his lens, we got startled by the howls of a whole bunch of coyotes coming from the ravine right next to where we were set up. I cannot express how quickly we packed up shop and revved out of there. Next time we'll have to remember to bring something to keep them away.

During one of our breaks from the cold sheltered in my van, Aqualung came over the radio, and I remembered how much I enjoyed Jethro Tull.
