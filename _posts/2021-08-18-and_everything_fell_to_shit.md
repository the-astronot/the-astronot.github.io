So, everything was going great, until it wasn't.
I was coming into my last week in Massachusetts, trying to wrap up as much of my telescope project as I could, when my 3d printer decided to stop functioning.
After a few hectic days fixing that up, creating more issues, and fixing those, we're back in business.
From that experience, I have learned that I cannot be trusted to work on hardware after midnight.

Of course, at the same time, my KM Switch also decided to go on the fritz, and now I have to rewire that too.
