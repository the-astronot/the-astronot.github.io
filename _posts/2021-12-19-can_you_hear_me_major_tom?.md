We have comms! I managed to set up a kind of protocol I can abide by to submit jobs, which now works from the terminal as well as the discord bot. Tomorrow's plan will be to try and actually get a submitted job to execute.

In addition, I thought I might try and make this site a bit more useable, so this is my first attempt at adding hyperlinks between posts. I guess we will see if it works. I set them up so that they should be generated by the python script I use to setup my baseline markdown post file, which means that once I get it right, I'll never have to think about it again!
