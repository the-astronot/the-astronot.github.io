So I got back to MA today and spent a bit of time making a blender model for my first mech. It turned out alright. Not great, but acceptable for now.
I also spent some thiking about how multiplayer would be accomplished. I really don't want to pay server costs, so ideally I'd like to have one player host the game and the others would join for each match.
Unfortunately, that does not work out well for the MMO aspect of the game, where the results of matches have lasting consequences on the universe at large.
So I spent some time thinking about that, and think I have found a solution. If I were to establish a kind of blockchain, that was shared with everyone who had an instance of the game running, and the host of each match would add the results to the chain after the match has completed. In this way, a ledger of wins and losses is kept so that the game might use the overall statistics to change in-game experiences, while working without permanent servers.
I'm not entirely sure whether the idea is feasible, it interests me greatly, and I plan on spending some time looking into/hacking on it when I get a chance.
