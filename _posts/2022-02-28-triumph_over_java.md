Song of the Day: [**I'm Still Standing**](https://youtu.be/ZHwVBirqD2s) - *Elton John*

After spending far too long on it, most of the Java section of the latest PSoft HW is done. I was given large swaths of code to implement, and 90 separate test cases that I had to pass. I hate the implementations I had to make, and I still have to go back and format all of the specifications etc, but I managed to dwindle the 90 down to 0. What a relief. I was very worried that this HW was going to end the same way as the Dafny one last week, collecting very, very few points for the amount of time and effort I spent on it. But I just checked, and I am currently receiving full credit from the autograder. What a relief...
