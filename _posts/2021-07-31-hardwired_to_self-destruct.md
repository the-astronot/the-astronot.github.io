Today, I wired up the Y-motor for the telescope.
I managed to both not electrocute myself, and actually get the stepper motor to spin.

I think it may just crack the list of the 5 jankiest things I've ever assembled. Hopefully I am able to fairly quickly design and print a holder for the battery and motor controllers to remove some of the jank from the system.
Below is my current CAD Model.

I will also have to make a note to deal with some heat dissipation.
