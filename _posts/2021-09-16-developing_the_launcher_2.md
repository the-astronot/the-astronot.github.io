Back to working on the launcher and hardware handling for my cluster computer. Feeling pretty okay about it. working on the error handling and transfering data between the separate processes.
There will be a lot of data back and forth between the hardware manager, job launcher, and website hosted on the main node that reports the status of the cluster.
