**25 April, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Lake Shore Drive**](https://youtu.be/0saZiLV7-7E) - *Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah*

Another swing and a miss.

This time, Alessandro and I went out to Lake Shore Rd in Raymertown to try and get away from the light pollutiuon coming off of Albany. We managed to find a spot thqat was plenty dark, but unfortunately visability was at a 0. We were lucky to see 2 stars in the whole sky. We took a picture or 2 to document that we had been there, but the trip was ultimately futile.

Fortunately, it seems that this Thursday night will be prime conditions for viewing. The current plan is to get back out there for Thursday and try to get some last second pics to process overnight for our meeting on Friday. Here's hoping it works out.
