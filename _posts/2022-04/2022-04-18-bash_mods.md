Song of the Day: [**Riders On The Storm**](https://youtu.be/iv8GW1GaoIc) - *The Doors*

I wasted today messing around with my bash terminal.

I don't think I could come up with a nerdier statement than that, but I have been dissatisfied with my terminal as of late.

I have come to realize that quite often, I am working in directories quite deep, and as such, have very little room left on the line to actually input commands. On top of that, I have been noticing a recent trend where my terminal overwrites commands when entering the next line or cycling through past commands. Together, those two issues have made using my terminal harder than it needed to be.

Do, today I ended up taking a deep dive into the inner workings of the .bashrc file and the PS1 variable in particular. In doing so, I managed to successfully transition the terminal prompt from one very long line to 1 line of misc data and then a newline on which to enter commands. I even added the current time, which I enjoy as a sort of faux-log.
