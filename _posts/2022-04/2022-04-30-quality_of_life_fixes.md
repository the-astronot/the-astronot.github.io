**30 April, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Glass Island**](https://youtu.be/JJZnNnCpapQ) - *Wax Fang*

So, some in-house improvements. The way I have been storing these posts has gotten a bit out of hand. They've all been just kind of sitting in one folder together, and it's made it pretty difficult to actually find specific posts or even maneuver around my editor.

So, I finally did something about it.

I was pretty worried that this change would end up cascading into something larger, since these Markdown files are auto-generated by a script I set up, but after only like 3 rounds of debugging and swearing, everything seems to be working alright.

I have some larger improvements on the way, so this site actually won't be updated for a few days, but this aspect is finished.
