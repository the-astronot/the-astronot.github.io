**12 April, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**We Are Young**](https://youtu.be/Sv6dMFF_yts) - *Fun.*

Today consisted of creating a short script to calculate what my final grade would be in one of my classes should either homework(s) or quiz(zes) be dropped. It is looking like this might be an option presented to us, and I like for everyone to be properly informed. So I wrote that script and shared it on the class discussion forum so that everyone might vote with their best interests in mind.

Later on, I spent some time working on the wopr repo. I have decided  that the ascii map will be generated each time the game is run based on the terminal size being used. To accomplish this, I have modified a map I found on the internet to include red and blue outlines around the Soviet Union and United States respectively. When run, the future algorithm will determine features from the map and choose how best to represent them using the ascii characters available to it.
