Song of the Day: [**Wolves Without Teeth**](https://youtu.be/VAI5GSyXMjA) - *Of Monsters and Men*

I cannot wait for this semester to end.

I feel like all I do anymore is sprint from one deadline to the next, barely pausing to catch my breath in between.

Tonight, it was my Algo Exam. After finishing my FDL write-up. After submitting an assignment for another class.

I prepared the best I could, but honestly, it could go either way. I do disagree with some of the material, however. In a class with a truly punishing grading style, spending so many points on **dynamic programming**, something that is almost by definition ethereal, with no real strategies for conquering other than getting lucky and being able to conceptualize the subproblems out of the ether. As one might imagine, I managed to figure out a few of them, but really, as a whole it was buckshot. Purely binary, getting it or not, on a problem by problem basis. I understand that the current content needs to be tested, but it would be nice to reflect the fact that this is all a bit luck based on the grading scheme, rather than punishing us with the final grade being the minimum of the exam and homework grades.

I guess there's no use complaining, but it feels better anyways.
