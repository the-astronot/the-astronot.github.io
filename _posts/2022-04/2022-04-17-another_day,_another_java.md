Song of the Day: [**Give and Take**](https://youtu.be/HHPZynI6pwQ) - *Poor Mans Poison*

More Java.

One more week, then I never have to touch it again.

This time, I had to modify my GraphADT to make it use generics. If only previous me could have imagined how much that was going to **suck**.

It boiled down to full rewrite of the entire data structure, as well as all of my previous code, as the running requirement for these homeworks is that our previous homeworks with these same files still compile and run correctly. So yeah, that was my day. After a lot of cursing and threatening my computer, I succeeded in converting all of the old code to use generics. I even managed to implement the actual homework for this week, using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find shortest paths within my graph after I finished all the rewrites.

Of course, I can't be allowed a full victory. I am currently losing a singular point on a part of an instructor test case. Somehow for one singular run, my implementation ends up with a path 1/3 the size of the expected one. I've tried submitting multiple times, and it is the same case each time. But every other far more detailed and intricate test case passes with flying colors. I have absolutely no idea what the issue could be.
