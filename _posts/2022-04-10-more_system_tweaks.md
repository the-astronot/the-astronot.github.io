Song of the Day: [**Spirit**](https://youtu.be/_gSsp7vasSA) - *Ghost*

I made some more tweaks to the system configuration.

It now includes a setup script that will add the repo to the user's path, and has some more minor edits that fixed some errors int the processing of some commands (I was accidentally chopping off the last letter).

Furthermore, I have made additions to the full setup configuration so as to bring it more into alignment with my current setup.

Next up, I'd like to fill out the filetypes a little more completely, adding bash scripts, correct Makefiles, etc.
