Song of the Day: [**Valhalla**](https://youtu.be/CZ_VFJn2kJM) - *Blind Guardian*

I was excited to get to work on the telescope today, especially after getting the x-axis belt tightened up last night.

Unfortunately, I realized I don't possess the materials required to get the new A4988 stepper motor drivers hooked up. A few clicks later, and I had some deliveries scheduled for Monday. I thought about wiring up my fight stick, but realized I was in the same boat there.

So, I figured I'd take another crack at the software for managing my cluster. And I did. I spent some time reworking what my queue printing looks like, and rewrote some code to try and set a max runtime for any particular job rather than trying to kill it after a certain point, which would get tricky when running jobs across multiple machines.
