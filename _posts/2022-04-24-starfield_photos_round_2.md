Song of the Day: [**Ashes**](https://youtu.be/crq-qc_r6Jk) - *The Longest Johns*

Alessandro and I went out back and tried for another round of starfield images now that the whether has warmed up. We're trying to get some of our images to work so that we can say that we were able to complete a run-through of the entire process, and our earlier photos were not sufficient for the tests. Since then, we have been using images taken from the ISS, which is largely fine, but we want our own through the cameras that would be used.

Unfortunately, while the local weather proved more hospitable for the data capture, the celestial weather was decidedly not so. We were barely able to get two or three stars per image, which will not suffice. So, I guess we'll be heading out and trying again in the next week.
