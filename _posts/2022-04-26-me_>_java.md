Song of the Day: [**All Alright**](https://youtu.be/mmKt0WaAPDQ) - *Fun.*

Finished up the final Java homework tonight.

I am so relieved to be able to put it behind me. This has been the worst experience programming that I have had yet. I would, in all honestly, rather write MIPS than this. I have realized too, that if I was set down with a piece of paper and a pencil, I would likely be unable to even begin to formulate a valid Java class. So much of this has been me learning momentarily to accomplish a task before moving on, that most of the code I wrote was basically me on autopilot.

Anyways, despite my better instincts to delete every trace of Eclipse and Java from my computer, I am leaving it until Thursday to be absolutely certian that there are no problems with the work I have submitted as the semester draws to a close. When that day comes, however, I will gleefully nuke every last class.
