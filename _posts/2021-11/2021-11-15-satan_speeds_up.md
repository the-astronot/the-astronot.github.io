Spent a fair amount of the last two days fixing the basic color ascii generator I uploaded on saturday. It's much better now, and can now handle RGBWCMYK, which gives me a few more colors to work with, which is nice.

With it, I managed to crank out this ascii version of one of my favorite album covers, **I'm In Your Mind Fuzz**, by *King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard*.

I've also tested the algorithm on various scenes from Initial D, and a few pieces of actual art, most notably *The Wave Off Kanagawa*, with some success. This is where I'll likely leave the project for a while, until Vinny and I can get together and work on it for real.
