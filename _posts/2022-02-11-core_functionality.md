Song of the Day: [**She's Kerosene**](https://youtu.be/Yq2jJLswL8I) - *The Interrupters*

SUCCESS!

I finally managed to get the software up and running for the cluster. Jobs can now be added and monitored, will be closed if the take too long, and can be moved throught the queues.

Granted, it isn't running on the actual cluster yet, just my desktop, but its a big milestone nonetheless.

Excited to do some cleaning up and function modification tomorrow.
