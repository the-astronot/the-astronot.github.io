Song of the Day: [**Post Party Depression**](https://youtu.be/3_ym8rdYPgY) - *Days N' Daze*

Found a site to help figure out when will be a good night to try and calibrate the star tracker, and now I'm left waiting for a halfway decent one. Today I refreshed this site, adding a place to drop helpful stuff like that website, as well as fixing how I store project files.
