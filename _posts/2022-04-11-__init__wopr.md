Song of the Day: [**Wish You Were Here**](https://youtu.be/hjpF8ukSrvk) - *Pink Floyd*

Big day...

I learned about Google's API in my search to create a script to turn the song of the days into a youtube playlist. I successfully created a short script to accomplish my goal, but it will likely need some further updating so that I might update the playlist with songs on a monthly basis, rather than its current setup, which does so yearly, and expends too many credits.

I also added/modified the system_setup repo with some new/improved file structures. I have noticed a new flaw in the system since I last reworked it, which will require some further modification in the future.

Plus, I saw the 1983 movie WarGames for the first time, which was very interesting. Aside from all of the existentially terrifying bits, I really enjoyed all of the retro tech, and have found the desire to make a low effort wopr/defcon clone in the terminal. I created the repo and set up the basic color/ansi codes required to create an interesting looking cli gui.
