**21 December, 2021**

Today I tried to implement some other fixes to this site after I got the next and previous buttons working the other day. Currently, I'm not planning on going back further to add them in in post, but at least they'll be there for the future. In that vein, I tried to fix my README page, which up until this point, broke on smaller screens or thinner browser screens. As of this moment, that issue has been fixed, and the large README title is replaced with an alternate smaller one if the screenwidth should become too thin.

In other news, today I officially became a dual major. Up until this point, due to the way RPI's CS dept deals with those trying to enter the major, I haven't been able to apply. But, as of this afternnon, I am officially in, and will be graduating in the Spring of 2023 with a degree in Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science. It's definitely a big weight off of my shoulders to have that squared away.

Oh, and I added a project page for this site, since I realized I might as well as I continue to try to improve it in the future.
