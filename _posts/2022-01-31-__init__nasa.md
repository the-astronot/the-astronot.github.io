Song of the Day: [**Jeopardy Waiting Music**](https://youtu.be/73tGe3JE5IU) - *Merv Griffin*

Finally starting up the repo for the independent study I am doing this semester with NASA Houston. 2 of my friends and I will be working on the testing and development of a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Star Tracker designed for use with cubeSATS and other small satellites. Today, the three of us got together and I helped everyoone get their raspberry pis set up. In doing so, Alessandro and I managed to find a solution to one of the issues that the designers had with PiCamera. To deal with high resolution images, we realizd that we had to modify the /boot/config.txt file to raise the gpu_mem to a higher value. Looking forward to spending more time getting the systems setup and calibrated.
