After a bit of messing around, we have power.

Tonight, I managed to once again supply power to the cluster through input from the head node. It has been quite a while since I last saw all of the red power indicators on at once.

Unfortunately, it appears I will have to poke around a bit on the electrical side of things before I can declare a full system boot. After several seconds of the cluster at full power, I started seeing individual nodes shut down and attempt to power up again, which happened last time when I couldn't supply the current required.

After all the code I've written, it feels good to see the lights. I know I have a ways to go, but this is a welcome milestone.
