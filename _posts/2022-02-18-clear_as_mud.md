Song of the Day: [**Rose Tattoo**](https://youtu.be/9d8SzG4FPyM) - *Dropkick Murphys*

After our meeting today, Alessandro and I went out into the backyard of our apartment with my pi and camera to try and get some starfield images. Due to an error, his machine required a reflash, which has further exposed the weaknesses of the system overall. No matter which machine he runs it on, the card with his OS on it will not allow the numpy library to be installed.

But back to the images...

Despite the lengthy time we spent outside, we were unable to capture any images of stars. It's likely this was not assisted by the full moon that just happened to perfectly line up with the first real break in the cloud cover. Though, to be fair, our backyard in Troy likely wasn't the best location to avoid light exposure.

All I have to show for my work is this image of the light of the moon.
