Update on the last week working on Project-Atlas:
- I designed and printed a guard rail to keep the carriage straight
- I designed and printed a GT2 compatible gear and a post for it to sit on to spin the body of the machine
- I screwed legs onto the machine
- I wrote code to drive the stepper motors
- Sawed off small parts that stuck off of the machine
- I printed and installed a receptacle for my Ryobi 18v batteries that power the machine
- I tested both motors in place and successfully drove the machine

I have learned that my cheap motor controllers cannot handle driving the stepper motors for any duration of time, and will have to look into alternatives.
