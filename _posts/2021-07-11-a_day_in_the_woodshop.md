Over the past week or two, one of the engineers at my summer internship has taken interest in my go-to telescope project, and had offered to give me some help with the woodworking aspects of it, for which I have little in the way of experience and tools.
On friday, he **very** kindly offered me an invitation to his workshop to work on assembling the base.
So, today I spent a few hours with him doing just that. We managed to get most of the base laid out, drilled, and routed. We also managed to attach the wooden body to the wooden base with a lazy susan style thing, and it went great!
**I can't believe how smoothly it rotates!**
All in all, a very productive day...
