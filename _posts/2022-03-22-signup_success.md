Song of the Day: [**If I Ever Leave This World Alive**](https://youtu.be/XCk81G8gnvE) - *Flogging Molly*

Fall classes have been signed up for!

Thankfully, Prof. Goldschmidt sent out an email over the weekend that clarified a few things about the fall and made it possible for me to sign up for a class that I had not previously had the pre-reqs for. I appreciate the hell out of him for sending that out when the school did not.

For the fall, I'm looking at only 14 credits so *fingers crossed* it should be pretty light in terms of coursework. I'm really hoping to end my college career with two relatively normal semesters and get one more chance to join some clubs and enjoy myself.

This week has sucked pretty hard so far, and its only Tuesday night. There's a lot of work to be done, and I'm hoping to get through it all without absolutely bombing any of it.

Wish me luck.
