In between studying for exams, I spent a bit of time working on/thinking about the new and improved job manager/launcher. Despite what the internet tries to tell me, it doesn't seem that Linux users actually use named pipes outside of bash programs, because I have been hunting all over for tutorials. I'm not even being picky really: I'd accept C, C++, Python, maybe even something else if it doesn't look too difficult, but the only help people seem to be giving out is for Win32, which doesn't exactly help me.

In the end, I decided to try figuring it out on my own with Python, as it is better setup for string processing and subprocess control. We'll see how it goes. Hell, maybe I'll make my own write-up about the process since no one else seems to have the answers for me.
