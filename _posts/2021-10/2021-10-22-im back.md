Well, that was a few weeks. Haven't really had much time to work on much of anything. Last few weeks have been all exams, and today my Preliminary Design Report for my capstone is due. Hopefully next week is better and I can actually get something I want to work on done. On the bright side, I'm sitting at an A- in Computer Organization, so that's pretty cool.

Very close to having software squared away to start running tests on my cluster. Would love to see it up and running soon.
