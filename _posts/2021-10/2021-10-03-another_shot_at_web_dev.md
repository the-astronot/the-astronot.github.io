So, after a **very** long week of homework and exams, I managed to get some time to myself, and decided to give the cluster's monitoring site another go.

A metric ton of caffeine and a few migraines later, I have a semi-functioning JS application running a React frontend and NodeJS as backend.

In it's current state, it takes a json file produced by the job manager and relays the data inside to the site.

It's very basic, but I am admittedly pretty proud of it. This is by far the furthest I've ever come to understanding any web dev stuff, and I feel good about it.

Hopefully this coming week will be less hectic, but I've also already got 2 exams scheduled, so I guess we'll see how long it takes before I get any more work on this done.
