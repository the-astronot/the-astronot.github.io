Song of the Day: [**In The Face Of Evil**](https://youtu.be/G02wKufX3nw) - *The Magic Sword*

After failing to get NextCloud set up locally yesterday, I finally admitted defeat and turned to my old enemy - docker. For once, the docker installation went reasonably well, and I now have a NextCloud installation up and running. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to get the cloudflare tunnel set up for the service as of yet. That has been giving me some trouble. Hopefully at some point in the future, I'll be able to resolve that issue.
