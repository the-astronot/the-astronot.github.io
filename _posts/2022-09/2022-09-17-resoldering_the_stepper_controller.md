Song of the Day: [**Horse With No Name**](https://youtu.be/oIYgsqhwXzM) - *America*

I was inspired to pick my telescope project back up. There is a lot of work to be done.

I tested attaching the raspberry pi to the stepper motor controllers, and realized that the pins of the controller had come off of the board. So, I figured that would be a good enough place to start. This time, I used some of the usb-a female connectors to act as the mount points for the stepper motors to the board. I figured that the wire sizes were approximately the same as the stepper wires, and since both sets have 4 sets of contacts, I might as well use the connector rather than making hard connections to the board itself.

Overall, I think I did a pretty good job. Definitely better than last time. I still have some more connections to make, and probably have another few hours of soldering ahead of me, but this was a good start. I also realized that I had not experimented with microstepping before, so I've also added another board with switches to try out different levels of microstepping.
