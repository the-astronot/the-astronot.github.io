Song of the Day: [**Save You**](https://youtu.be/yXJomD8BBC8) - *Pearl Jam*

My 3 4TB drives showed up today! It made for a nice end to my week. With them, in combination with the PCIE to SATA board I got in yesterday, I managed to get all of the drives installed in my NAS chassis and powered up. I set them up as a ZFS pool in TrueNAS with one drive of failure allowed. Hopefully this setup will serve me well, and not completely crap out on me in the next year.

I guess I'll see how it goes.
