Song of the Day: [**Camouflage**](https://youtu.be/eJkO4kHmOOs) - *Sabaton*

After setting up my new NAS drives yesterday, I set up a file transfer from my desktop to the NAS of all of my Plex media. I left that running overnight, and today I completed the process of migrating my plex server over to my server rack. I have the NAS sharing an NFS share of the full ZFS pool with my R620 which runs the Plex service.

I did some preliminary testing today, and the new hardware seems to perform at least as well as the old stuff, so I guess my GPU wasn't doing any hardware encoding after all. This setup should serve me alright so long as I stay at 1080p, which I don't foresee changing any time soon.

I spent a long while trying to get some version of a self-hosted nextcloud service, to no avail. I definitely still want to get something similar to that service set up, as I would really like to have a cloud backup for photos/documents, and would rather avoid using a 3rd party option when I have a setup all ready to go here.
