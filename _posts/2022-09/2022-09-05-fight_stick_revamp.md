Song of the Day: [**Fever Dreams**](https://youtu.be/QAY3DCizvh0) - *Dio*

After getting tired of trying to get more networking stuff set up today, I changed gears and spent a while rewiring my previously abandoned fight stick. After today, it has become something of a cursed object...

I wired up the 8 buttons using cat5e network cable and a connector. My original plan was to make it as easy as possible to separate the arduino from the rest of the chassis in case  I ever burnt it out or it required some maintenance. I am glad to say that I accomplished that goal, but at a cost.
