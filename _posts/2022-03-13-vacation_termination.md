Song of the Day: [**A Hazy Shade of Winter**](https://youtu.be/dVA-1iJxRQI) - *Simon & Garfunkel*

Last day of spring break.

I made a few ethernet cables for the cluster and realized that I'm having some issues getting enough current to the splitter. I think I'm going to have to run an extra line of the 14 gauge wire from the PSU to the splitter. Hopefully that'll allow me to get all 6 worker nodes powered on at the same time and update the software.

We'll see what I find time to accomplish, as I'm back to classes tomorrow.
