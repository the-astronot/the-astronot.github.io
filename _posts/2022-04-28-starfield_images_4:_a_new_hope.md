**28 April, 2022**

Song of the Day: [**Oak & Ash & Thorn**](https://youtu.be/mr1CM_yw68c) - *The Longest Johns*

AN actual clear night!

What are the odds?

Went out into a lot on the corner of my street and tried **yet again** to capture some starfield images to run through the NASA software. I was actually able to see stars this time around, which is a good sign, and I have some decent looking images that I am hopeful will be able to be reduced down to quaternion values. *Fingers crossed*

**ADDENDUM:**
**Spoiler Alert** from future Max, **they did not.**

I really don't know what to do at this point. The ISS photos are working fine, but nothing else seems to want to cooperate.
