# untitled_unity_game

**Status:** On hold, I just don't have the time and ability

**Description:** My idea for a video game I want to develop using Unity and Blender. It should be a good exercise in teaching me how to better use both programs.
Overall, its a game about fighting mechs, with heavy emphasis on customization and an overarching MMO campaign.
