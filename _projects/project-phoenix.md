## Project-Phoenix

**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Everything I have gathered, built, or written to allow for me to run 2 separate desktops at once as easily as possible: Windows and Linux.

**Hardware:**
So far I know I will need a KM switch to allow me to connect one Keyboard/Mouse set to both computers and toggle them between the two. More may be required, we'll see where that takes us.

**Software:**
I know I'm going to need some software to allow me to copy and paste between the two computers as simply as possible.
