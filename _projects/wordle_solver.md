## wordle_solver

**Start_Date:** 1/29/22

**Status:** In Limbo

**Description:** After playing wordle for a few days, I wondered if I could design an algorithm to play it. So, I borrowed the site's dictionary and created an outline of a program to resize the dictionary based on new information. I did this by coming up with a hash system to quickly determine if a letter was in any particular word.

**Hardware:** None

**Software:** [Repo](https://github.com/the-astronot/wordle_solver)

**Pictures:**
