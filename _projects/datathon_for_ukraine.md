## datathon_for_ukraine

**Start_Date:** 3/26

**End_Date:** 3/27

**Status:** Hackathon

**Description:** RPI-hosted Datathon for Ukraine, using publicly available data related to the War in Ukraine for extrapolation and anaylsis. My group focused on Ukraine's role as one of the worlds largest grain exporters, along with Russia, and the toll that the war will take on the world's grain supply. Personally, I used the time writing scripts to download images of Ukraine's NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) available through NASA's [GIMMS Global Agricultural Monitoring](https://glam1.gsfc.nasa.gov/) site.

**Hardware:** None

**Software:** [Repo](https://github.com/ITWS-Hackathon/Grain_production_Ukraine)
