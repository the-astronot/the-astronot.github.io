# Project-Doge

**Status:** Largely completed, abandoned

**Description:** My project to make a bot that automates speculating on Dogecoin. Originally started as a meme, I was surprised when my crappy AI managed to do a halfway decent job, and switched the project slightly to speculate on Bitcoin instead, where I only had to pay half the transfer fees with each exchange.
More recently, I have looked into the prospect of cuttign out the AI entirely, and instead focus on ratios between different coins across the market, and capitalizing on discrepancies between them to make gains.
