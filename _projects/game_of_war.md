## game_of_war

**Start_Date:** 01/02/2023

**Status:** On-going

**Description:** Originally born from my questioning aloud what Conway's Game of Life would look like if the cells belonged to different factions, game_of_war is now a strategy game where warring factions attempt to capture each other's captials and be the last left standing. At the moment, the game is being developed with the intention to have challengers write code to win the game, similar to [Terminal](https://terminal.c1games.com/), but we hope at some point to also add support for human players.

Collaboration with [Vincent Rizzari](https://github.com/rizzarivincent).

**Hardware:** None

**Software:** [Repo](https://github.com/rizzarivincent/game_of_war)
