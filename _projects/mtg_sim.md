## mtg_sim

**Start_Date:** 12/20/2022

**Status:** On-going

**Description:** My attempt at reproducing a simulator for the card game "Magic the Gathering" in Python. This seemed like an interesting project due to the varied nature of the cards and fluidity of the rules around them. It seemed to me that the best way to make a general simulator would be to create my own proto-language to write the cards interactions with the environment in.

**Hardware:** None

**Software:** [Repo](https://github.com/the-astronot/mtg_sim)

**Pictures:** Not much to show at the moment, at some point I'd like to add some sort of basic GUI for the project to make it more usable.
